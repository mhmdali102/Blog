# My first real project XeroLinux.  

Hello, I'm Mhmd Ali, a Front-End Web developer and this is my personal blog and my first post actually, in this post I'll share my process of designing and building my first real project [XeroLinux](https://xerolinux.xyz).  


## How it started?

First of all, I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqCTzdLNeXY) on [DistroTube YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube) showing the distro, I really liked the distro and how it looks so nice, then I head to the official website to download it, and I realized that the website don't have the same feelings of the distro and I thought that I can do better, so I joined [XeroLinux Telegram channel](https://t.me/xerolinux) and I sent a message with mentioning DarkXero (the Creator and maintainer of XeroLinux) if he is planning to redesinging XeroLinux website and the answer was YES!

## My redesign Process!

At this point I made a quick mvp with [Figma](https://figma.com) showing my idea to DarkXero, of course no thing is perfect from the first time so I kept tweaking the design for about two weeks until we agreed on this desing below.

### the Re-Design (After):

The idea was to make the website looks and feels same as the Distro specifically the XeroCerry rice.

## Building the website

Now it's time to build the website, I created the website with ReactJS since it is the language that I'm comfortable, It tooked around 2 weeks to finish it. but the problem was that DarkXero wanted an easy way to update the Changelog, Announcements, Videos and the FAQs without changing the source code, so I made everything he need to update in a json file, except for the Pop Ups because they do not have a single layout or a fixed content, I kept thinking for a solution until I remembered [NoteDown](https://github.com/mhmdali102/NoteDown), this is a tool/notes web app I've created while I was learning JavaScript to take notes with Markdown syntax with many useful features. Since he knows Markdown I configured the tool to preview Markdown in the same styles for XeroLinux website, [click here to try the configured tool](https://xero-md2html.netlify.app/).

## My experience

It was a good experience, I'm grateful that my first project was something that I love,
and I enjoyed working on it, and DarkXero is an awesome person, I'm happy that I met him.


Thank you for reading, what do you think about it? Any advice would be much appreciate it...
